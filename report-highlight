Why this matters for our security posture: 
It identifies missing critical KB updates that could leave systems exposed. 
It enhances visibility into patch compliance across diverse locations. 
Helps vulnerability management efforts by pinpointing systems that require attention. 

Key Highlights: Remote audit across 20,000+ devices with parallel execution for speed and efficiency. 
Remotely checks update health, system readiness, and WSUS connectivity.

Checks for: specific KBs’ presence.
  * Free disk space & good SCCM cache
  * Last reboot
  * WSUS & Windows Update server test
✅ Extracts SCCM WMI `CCM_SoftwareUpdate` ‘existence’ **real-time update status**
✅ Generates user-friendly **CSV reports** along with error hyperlinks & **color-coded HTML dashboard** from descriptive YAML/JSON config file.
✅ Lists devices as **contactable/non-contactable** for easier following up.

### ✅ Security Audit Milestone: Enterprise-Wide Windows Update Compliance Report

We’ve completed the development and execution of a PowerShell-based audit system to assess Windows update compliance across our fleet of **20,000+ SCCM-managed endpoints**.

#### 🔐 Why this matters for our security posture:

* **Identifies missing critical KB updates** that could leave systems exposed.
* **Enhances visibility** into patch compliance across diverse locations and WSUS configurations.
* **Supports vulnerability management efforts** by pinpointing systems that require attention.

#### 📊 Key Highlights:

* ✅ Remote audit across **20,000+ devices** with **parallel execution** for speed and efficiency.
* ✅ Checks for:

  * Presence of specific KBs
  * Disk space & SCCM cache health
  * Restart status
  * WSUS & Windows Update server reachability
* ✅ Gathers **real-time update status** via SCCM WMI (`CCM_SoftwareUpdate`)
* ✅ Produces actionable **CSV reports** and a **color-coded HTML dashboard** with error hyperlinks.
* ✅ Categorizes systems as **reachable/unreachable** to streamline follow-up actions.

🎯 **Outcome:** A powerful, scalable reporting framework that enhances our ability to monitor patch health and proactively strengthen our security defenses.





---------------------------------------


### ✅ Project Milestone: Automated Windows Update Audit & Remediation at Scale

We’ve successfully developed and deployed an advanced PowerShell-based solution to **proactively audit and trigger Windows updates** across our fleet of **20,000+ SCCM-managed devices**.

#### 🔐 Why this matters for our security posture:

* **Closes critical security gaps** by identifying systems missing approved KB patches.
* **Strengthens compliance** with internal patching SLAs and external security frameworks.
* **Reduces attack surface** by ensuring timely remediation of vulnerable endpoints.

#### 🚀 Key Highlights:

* ✅ Remotely checks update health, system readiness, and WSUS connectivity.
* ✅ Retrieves real-time patch status using SCCM WMI classes (`CCM_SoftwareUpdate`).
* ✅ Triggers updates from Software Center and monitors error codes live.
* ✅ Operates **in parallel across 20,000+ machines** to minimize execution time.
* ✅ Produces detailed **CSV and color-coded HTML reports** for tracking and audit.
* ✅ Automatically detects **unreachable or unhealthy SCCM clients** for remediation.

🎯 **Impact:** Improved visibility, faster patching cycles, and reinforced endpoint security—without user disruption.

Big thanks to everyone who supported testing and validation!

### 🔐 Security Visibility Uplift: Real-Time Patch Audit Framework for Retail Devices

We’re excited to share a major milestone in our effort to harden the security posture of our retail fleet:
A custom-built **PowerShell-based audit framework** now enables real-time, at-scale visibility into Windows update status across **20,000+ SCCM-managed devices**.

#### 🛡️ Why this matters:

* Our **Cybersecurity team regularly assesses patch compliance**, especially for critical CVEs like CVE-XXXX-XXXX.
* Historically, identifying why certain retail devices failed to patch was **time-consuming, manual, and error-prone**, often missing systems due to scale and timing.
* Now, this framework delivers a **comprehensive audit snapshot** — automatically, in parallel, and at scale.

#### ⚙️ How it works:

* Takes a list of devices missing a specific KB (e.g., related to a CVE).
* Remotely connects and performs real-time checks including:

  * ✅ Whether the KB is already installed
  * ✅ Disk space and SCCM cache health
  * ✅ WSUS/Windows Update server connectivity (DNS + port)
  * ✅ Pending restart status
  * ✅ Available updates from SCCM (`CCM_SoftwareUpdate`)
  * ✅ Update error codes retrieved live from device logs

#### 📊 Output & Impact:

* Generates a **one-page, color-coded HTML report** and detailed CSV logs.
* Highlights root causes clearly — from low disk space to unreachable WSUS.
* **Cuts down hundreds of manual hours**, replacing guesswork with data.
* Enables faster, smarter decision-making for patch follow-up and remediation planning.
* Most importantly, it helps us **proactively close gaps in our security posture** — bringing us closer to **100% update compliance** across the retail environment.

🎯 **Result:** A scalable, automated audit tool that transforms how we detect, report, and respond to patching gaps — a vital win for retail device security.
